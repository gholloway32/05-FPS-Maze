 first person shooter maze 4/9/2022
 
First person mase shooter made in GODOT with enemys,key to unlock the exit.

# Implecations
My games has a procedurally-generated maze that is populated with enemys the snarl at you which you can shoot with a gun with muzzle flash, and gun sound which leaves bullent holes. you explore this maze while lising to music until you either die or find the key which gives you a collected sound which unlockes a red light which turns green once you have the key. once you find the exit you win with victory music.
